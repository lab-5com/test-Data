# Data Engineering Test Suite

Welcome to our Data Engineering Test Suite, a comprehensive umbrella project designed to evaluate and develop skills across various data engineering domains, including streaming data processing and DBT (Data Build Tool)-inspired projects.

## Getting Started

This repository serves as a starting point for a series of technical tests aimed at assessing and improving your capabilities in modern data engineering practices. Whether you're a seasoned expert or new to the field, this suite offers challenges designed to showcase your skills in real-world scenarios.

### Projects Overview

- **Streaming Data Processing Test**: Develop a streaming application that joins two datasets in real-time. More details can be found in [DATA-ENGINEERING-STREAMING.md](DATA-ENGINEERING-STREAMING.md).

- **DBT-Inspired Projects**: Implement data transformation workflows using principles inspired by DBT. Specific challenges and guidelines are provided in their respective markdown files within this repository.
